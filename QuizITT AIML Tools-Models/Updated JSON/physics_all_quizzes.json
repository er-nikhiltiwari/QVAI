The applied force must overcome both of these to maintain constant speed: F = f + mgsin(\u03b8) \u2248 3.4 + 9.8 = 13.2 N. Finally, the power is P = Fv = 13.2 N * 1 m/s = 13.2 W.

The force due to q2 is F21 = k * (2q * q) / a^2 = 2kq^2 / a^2 to the right. The force due to q3 is F31 = k * (2q * q) / (2a)^2 = k * (2q^2) / (4a^2) = kq^2 / (2a^2) to the left. Since F21 > 2*F31,  F21 is larger. Hence, the *magnitude* of the force is F21 - F31 = (2 - 1/2)(kq^2 / a^2) = 3/2 (kq^2/a^2).  However, because q2 is closer and twice as large as q3, the force that it applies to q1 in the positive direction is significantly stronger, however the *direction* of this force is on the *opposite* side due to the negative force. Thus, the combined force on q1 is directed to the left.",

When lenses are in contact, the total power is the sum of the individual powers: P_total = P1 + P2 = 5 + (-10) = -5 Diopters.
