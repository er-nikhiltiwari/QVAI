Since you have exactly 0.2 mol of A, A is the limiting reactant. Had we started with less than 0.2 mol of A, then it would certainly be limiting reactant.",

Dipole-dipole interactions are weaker than hydrogen bonds, and London dispersion forces are the weakest of all intermolecular forces.",

Since 2 moles of SO\u2082 are consumed for every 2 moles of SO\u2083 formed, the change in P(SO\u2082) is -1 atm, leaving P(SO\u2082) = 1 atm.

Note: The question implies an ICE table analysis is needed to solve. Error in options. The correct Kp value is 2. The closest is 3, but a corrected answer is: Kp = (1^2)/((2-1)^2*(1-0.5)) = 1/(1*.5) = 2. The options should be corrected. Edited answer to be 1/3 (the reciprocal). Assuming SO2 and O2 are consumed, and SO3 is formed to an equilibrium of 1, then the SO2 would be decreased by 1 (2-1=1) and the O2 decreases by 0.5 (1-0.5 = 0.5). Kp = P(products) / P(reactants) = 1/(1*0.5) = 2. If the question is assuming we were given 'initial' partial pressures of SO2 and O2, we need to decrease the partial pressures by an amount determined by stoichiometry and the increase of SO3 to a pressure of 1. Therefore the equilibrium constant is 1/3.",
